What is this mod?
This mod seeks to combine the multitude of zombie stat modifying mods into one cohesive package. If you prefer how another mod handles a zombie stat, you can disable the corresponding stat in Definitive Zombies.

Definitive Zombies comes with a "realistic" preset so you do not have to adjust any settings:
Daylight gives a boost to the zombie's sight and memory
Night lowers zombies sight and memory. They gain a boost to their hearing
Temperature slows the zombies down when the weather reaches 0C (32F)
Fog greatly reduces the zombie's sight and memory
Rain reduces the zombies sight and hearing, heavier rain affects their memory as well
Snow reduces the zombies sight and memory
Clouds slightly reduces the zombie's sight and memory
Wind will reduce the zombie's hearing ability
Moon phases negates the negatives of the night when a full moon appears, boosting the zombies sight and memory

There are other stats which are turned off by default:
Time of day will affect zombie's stats, this is set up with a dawn/dusk cycle
Randomisation contains a suite of settings to randomise the zombies. Want 5% of sprinters to ignore the temperature? This is the setting for you
