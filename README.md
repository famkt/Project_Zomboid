What is this mod?<br />
This mod seeks to combine the multitude of zombie stat modifying mods into one cohesive package. If you prefer how another mod handles a zombie stat, you can disable the corresponding stat in Definitive Zombies.

Definitive Zombies comes with a "realistic" preset so you do not have to adjust any settings:<br />
Daylight gives a boost to the zombie's sight and memory<br />
Night lowers zombies sight and memory. They gain a boost to their hearing<br />
Temperature slows the zombies down when the weather reaches 0C (32F)<br />
Fog greatly reduces the zombie's sight and memory<br />
Rain reduces the zombies sight and hearing, heavier rain affects their memory as well<br />
Snow reduces the zombies sight and memory<br />
Clouds slightly reduces the zombie's sight and memory<br />
Wind will reduce the zombie's hearing ability<br />
Moon phases negates the negatives of the night when a full moon appears, boosting the zombies sight and memory<br />

There are other stats which are turned off by default:<br />
Time of day will affect zombie's stats, this is set up with a dawn/dusk cycle<br />
Randomisation contains a suite of settings to randomise the zombies. Want 5% of sprinters to ignore the temperature? This is the setting for you<br />
